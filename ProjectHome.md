The aim of this project is that you can do the following:

  1. Take a laser pointer, webcam, and video projector.
  1. Connect them to your computer.
  1. Place the camera in the vicinity of the projector.
  1. Now, simply use the laser pointer as a pointing device (read: mouse) to control your computer!

This might potentially be useful as a remote control device for home cinema (it is for me), or as an input device for presentations. Or maybe it's just something I wrote because I think it's cool.
