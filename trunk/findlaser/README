This is only the beginning of a README. Let's list the
dependencies for now:

DEPENDENCIES
============

All library dependencies imply that both the library
and the corresponding headers are required.

- libjpeg (jpeglib.h)  --> for processing the camera's images

- SDL                  --> for displaying the calibration programs
- SDL_image
- SDL_ttf
- SDL_rotozoom         (part of libsdl-gfx1.2-dev package in
                        debian-based distributions)

- X-libs               --> for setting the mouse cursor position

- The "linux/videodev.h" header (Video4Linux if I remember correctly,
                                 part of the kernel here.)


INSTALLATION
============

- Install the dependencies.
- run "make"
- connect the camera
- set up the camera so it can conceivable see the whole video
  projector image.
- If you have one, put the red-filter in front of the camera.
  That improves the sensitivity *significantly*.
- potentially edit settings.txt (refer to the code in
  src/Configuration.* for the meaning) to adapt to your display and
  camera resolution. For now, running the camera in 320x240 mode is
  recommended.
- run bin/sdl. You will get one camera image in a window.
  Hit v (quickly, it repeats almost instantly) to go into continuous
  mode. Use this to make the camera see the whole projected image with
  as little distortion as possible. A slight vertical tilt should be
  correctable.
- Use the other keybindings to set up the brightness/contrast as well
  as the laser pointer brightness and color thresholds.
  (TODO -- document)
  Use your laser pointer (NEEDS TO BE RED!)
  for this and switch to color threshold or brightness threshold
  view with 1/2/3. "a" toggles full screen. Beware of the feedback loop.
- run bin/geoCalib to do the geometry calibration. Point the laser
  at the small blue squares for some time. (Don't shake!)
  Do this four times (for all corners).
- run bin/findLaser. It will set your mouse cursor to the laser
  pointer position.
